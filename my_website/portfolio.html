    <h2>Wizard Game</h2>
    <p class="reflection">The purpose of this game was to make the
    wizard catch the fruits. It was the first introduction we had to making scripts
    and creating a game. One of the scripts was used to move the wizard girl. By
    utilizing an four if-then blocks, the wizard sprite was able to be controlled
    by the four arrow keys. ANother script in the game was in charge of getting all
    the fruit to appear. This one also used an if-then block, in addition to a block
    that played sound and multiple that changed the costume of the fruit sprite.
    One difficult thing that I encountered was understanding just exactly what all
    the blocks did. Even though a lot of them were self-explanatory, the instructions
    we had didn't really tell us what each block did, it just told us to make the
    scripts look like that.</p> <br>
    <h2>Panda Panda Panda</h2>
    <p class="reflection">The purpose of this game was to help the
    panda catch all the bamboo as it fell from the top of the screen. One of the
    scripts was used to control the transition between the intro to the actual
    game. In this script, the backdrop changed to the bamboo forest when the arrow
    sprite was clicked. As a result, this caused another script to come into play.
    When the backdrop changed to the bamboo forest, it was the actual game play. 
    The backdrop change caused the panda sprite's costume to change and go to a
    designated spot. Using a forever loop, an if-else statement was used to allow
    players to move the panda using left and right arrow keys. One difficulty that
    we had was creating a button to skip the introduction after the game was lost and
    players wanted to restart it. We couldn't exactly figure out how to get the reset
    button to do the same exact thing without disrupting all the other sprites, but I'm
    sure that if we spent more time on it we could have figured it out.</p>
