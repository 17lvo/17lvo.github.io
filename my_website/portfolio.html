    <h2>Wizard Game</h2>
    <p class="reflection">The purpose of this game was to make the wizard catch
    the fruits. It was the first introduction we had to making scripts and creating
    a game. One of the scripts was used to move the wizard girl. By utilizing four
    if-then blocks, the wizard sprite was able to be controlled by the four arrow
    keys on a keyboard. Another script in the game was in charge of getting all
    the fruit to appear. This one also used an if-then block, in addition to a block
    that played a sound whenever the wizard sprite touced the fruit. Other blocks 
    changed the costume of the fruit sprites when they were touched by the wizard.
    One difficult thing that I encountered was understanding just exactly what all
    the blocks did. Even though a lot of them were self-explanatory, the instructions
    we had didn't really tell us what each block did, it just told us to make the
    scripts look like that. We had to learn by ourselves along the way and try different
    things to figure out what they did.</p>

    <h2>Panda Panda Panda</h2>
    <p class="reflection">The purpose of this game is to help the panda catch all
    the bamboo as it falls from the top of the screen. One of the scripts in the
    game is used to control the transition between the intro and the actual
    game. In this script, the backdrop changes to the bamboo forest when the arrow
    sprite is clicked. When the backdrop changes to the bamboo forest, the code
    for the actual game play starts. The backdrop change causes the panda sprite's 
    costume to change and go to a designated spot. Using a forever loop, an if-else 
    statement allows players to move the panda using left and right arrow keys. 
    One difficulty that we had was creating a button to skip the introduction after
    someone lost and wanted to restart the game without going through the backstory
    again. We couldn't exactly figure out how to get the reset button to start the 
    game the same way without disrupting all the other sprites, but we were able to 
    cut down the transition time between the two parts of the game to make it a little
    easier.</p>

	  <h2>Bubba's Quest for Boba</h2>
    <p class="reflection">Bubba is a unicorn from Scotland who wants to travel to California
    to try boba. He faces a lot of difficult decisions, and depending on what choices he
    makes, Bubba goes on a search for the ingredients to make his own boba.
    In order to produce the story, my partner and I used Python in cloud 9 and
    later transfered our code over to repl.it. We had to know how to use if, else,
    and elif statements in our program to successfully complete the story. One
    problem we faced was the case-sensitivity of the answeres that people would put in.
    In order to fix this, we used "or" to allow people to use both uppercase and lowercase
    letters. One thing that I liked about this projec was that it was a lot easier to 
    carry out the vision we had. With the Scratch games, we had a lot of ideas but we either
    didn't know how to write the code or we were on a time crunch and couldn't accomplish
    everything we wanted. The only thing I disliked was how cluttered it would look if we 
    didn't go back and put empty lines in between certain paragraphs. Some other stories that 
    I liked were The Party: Richard and the ship-wrecked game whose name I can't remember.
    The party game was really pleasing to read through because the lines came out after a 
    few seconds, which made it less cluttered to read. The ship-wrecked game was also pleasing
    to look at because there was art and line breaks to clearly separate different parts of the 
    story. One thing I would improve on next time is the organization of our story, as sometimes
    it was overwhelming to read.</p>
