        <h3>Grade: 12</h3>
        <p>Hello hello my name is Lina and I am currently a senior! I love doggos, especially husky mixes and corgi mixes.
        Everyday I look forward to 11:11 because that means it's another chance to make a wish. My biggest wish in life is to travel
        each continent with a different friend beacuse I think it would be cool to think of one of your closest friends and associate
        them with memories from a specific place. I am quite the daydreamer but ironically I don't know what I want to pursue in the future.
        It's okay though because I like everything going on in my life right now, which includes marching band, swim, and KIWIN'S!</p>
